Another Set of Git Add-on Tools
===============================

This set of Git add-on tools was inspired by the `git-plus` project on GitHub:

    https://github.com/tkrajina/git-plus

I had made a bunch of improvements and enhancements to that project, but they
didn't fit with desires of that projects maintainer. My fork of that project can
be found here:

    https://github.com/troth/git-plus

Additionally, I really only use the `git-multi` tool from that project and there
are some features of that version of `git-multi` that I find not really useful.

Hence, the birth of this project.
